## 🗺️ Overview

Pronto is a Python library to parse, browse, create, and export
ontologies, supporting several ontology languages and formats. It
implement the specifications of the
[Open Biomedical Ontologies 1.4](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html)
in the form of an safe high-level interface. *If you're only interested in
parsing OBO or OBO Graphs document, you may wish to consider
[`fastobo`](https://pypi.org/project/fastobo) instead.*


## 🏳️ Supported Languages

- [Open Biomedical Ontologies 1.4](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/GO.format.obo-1_4.html).
  *Because this format is fairly new, not all OBO ontologies can be parsed at the
  moment. See the [OBO Foundry roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/fastobo/projects/2)
  listing the compliant ontologies, and don't hesitate to contact their developers
  to push adoption forward.*
- [OBO Graphs](https://github.com/geneontology/obographs) in [JSON](http://json.org/)
  format. *The format is not yet stabilized to the results may change from file
  to file.*
- [Ontology Web Language 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/)
  in [RDF/XML format](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-mapping-to-rdf-20121211/).
  *OWL2 ontologies are reverse translated to OBO using the mapping defined in the
  [OBO 1.4 Semantics](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html).*

## 🔧 Installing


Installing with `pip` is the easiest:
```console
# pip install pronto          # if you have the admin rights
$ pip install pronto --user   # install it in a user-site directory
```

There is also a `conda` recipe in the `bioconda` channel:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pronto
```

Finally, a development version can be installed from GitHub
using `setuptools`, provided you have the right dependencies
installed already:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/althonos/pronto
$ cd pronto
# python setup.py install
```

## 💡 Examples

If you're only reading ontologies, you'll only use the `Ontology`
class, which is the main entry point.

```python
>>> from pronto import Ontology
```

It can be instantiated from a path to an ontology in one of the supported
formats, even if the file is compressed:
```python
>>> go = Ontology("tests/data/go.obo.gz")
```

Loading a file from a persistent URL is also supported, although you may also
want to use the `Ontology.from_obo_library` method if you're using persistent
URLs a lot:
```python
>>> cl = Ontology("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cl.obo")
>>> stato = Ontology.from_obo_library("stato.owl")
```

### 🏷️ Get a term by accession

`Ontology` objects can be used as mappings to access any entity
they contain from their identifier in compact form:
```python
>>> cl['CL:0002116']
Term('CL:0002116', name='B220-low CD38-positive unswitched memory B cell')
```

Note that when loading an OWL ontology, URIs will be compacted to CURIEs
whenever possible:

```python
>>> aeo = Ontology.from_obo_library("aeo.owl")
>>> aeo["AEO:0000078"]
Term('AEO:0000078', name='lumen of tube')
```

### 🖊️ Create a new term from scratch

We can load an ontology, and edit it locally. Here, we add a new protein class
to the Protein Ontology.
```python
>>> pr = Ontology.from_obo_library("pr.obo")
>>> brh = ms.create_term("PR:XXXXXXXX")
>>> brh.name = "Bacteriorhodopsin"
>>> brh.superclasses().add(pr["PR:000001094"])  # is a rhodopsin-like G-protein
>>> brh.disjoint_from.add(pr["PR:000036194"])   # disjoint from eukaryotic proteins
```

### ✏️ Convert an OWL ontology to OBO format

The `Ontology.dump` method can be used to serialize an ontology to any of the
supported formats (currently OBO and OBO JSON):
```python
>>> edam = Ontology("http://edamontology.org/EDAM.owl")
>>> with open("edam.obo", "wb") as f:
...     edam.dump(f, format="obo")
```

### 🌿 Find ontology terms without subclasses

The `terms` method of `Ontology` instances can be used to
iterate over all the terms in the ontology (including the
ones that are imported). We can then use the `is_leaf`
method of `Term` objects to check is the term is a leaf in the
class inclusion graph.

```python
>>> ms = Ontology("ms.obo")
>>> for term in ms.terms():
...     if term.is_leaf():
...         print(term.id)
MS:0000000
MS:1000001
...
```
