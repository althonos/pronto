comment: This is the term which was just "heart measurement". Since it was under body morphological measurement it seemed to clearly refer to a morphological measurement. I made this term more specific so that another term for "heart measurement" could be added to the ontology above it which would also be a parent to other non-morphological heart-related terms.

The LDL class of lipoproteins has a density between 1.019 and 1.063 g/ml. In some animal species, such as canine and rodents, this may overlap with the HDL1 class and be designated LDL/HDL1." [BioMedCentral:http\://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/9/47, Multiple_Dictionaries:http\://www.thefreedictionary.com/, Website:http\://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipoproteins.php]
comment: Values for density ranges of the lipoprotein classes are approximate.  The classes may be defined differently by different researchers, in part because class definitions depend on the number of subclasses into which the lipoprotein fractions are divided.

name: adipocyte basal glucose uptake
def: "Measurement of the unstimulated, baseline or lowest possible amount of glucose transported into a fat cell. Glucose is the monosaccharide sugar which is the principal circulating sugar in the blood and the major energy source of the body. Fat cells are connective tissue cells specialized for the synthesis and storage of fat; such cells consist of a large cytoplasmic vesicle filled with globules of triglycerides with the nucleus displaced to one side and the cytoplasm seen as a thin line around the fat vesicle."

def: "The difference in the amount of glucose transported into a fat cell between two conditions, for example between the basal or baseline state and a stimulated state, such as occurs with administration of insulin." [Multiple_Dictionaries:http\://www.thefreedictionary.com/]

In this context it is not intended to necessarily imply the difference expressed as an absolute value |n|, that is, the numeric value of the difference without regard to its sign.

def: "Measurement of the amount of phospholipid, any of various phosphorus-containing lipids that are composed mainly of fatty acids, a phosphate group, and a simple organic molecule such as glycerol, carried in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) molecules in a specified volume of blood, the fluid that circulates through the heart, arteries, capillaries and veins carrying nutrients and oxygen to the body tissues and metabolites away from them. VLDL constitute a class of large (e.g. approximately 30-80 nm in diameter) lipoprotein particles, complex molecules that consist of a protein membrane surrounding a core of lipids. The VLDL class of lipoproteins has a density between 0.95 and 1.006 g/ml." [Multiple_Dictionaries:http\://www.thefreedictionary.com/, Website:http\://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipoproteins.php]
comment: Values for density ranges of the lipoprotein classes are approximate.  The classes may be defined differently by different researchers, in part because class definitions depend on the number of subclasses into which the lipoprotein fractions are divided.

def: "Measurement of the amount of a specific autoantibody determined as the maximal dilution of the autoantibody solution at which that antibody can still be detected. The value represents the denominator of the dilution ratio, i.e., a titer of 32 means that the sample can be maximally diluted 1/32 and still contain enough antibody to be detected. An antibody is an immunoglobulin molecule possessing a specific amino acid sequence that binds to a specific antigen, a substance introduced into an organism which initiates an immune response including the production of the very antibodies which bind to it in an effort to destroy it. An autoantibody is an antibody that attacks the cells, tissues, native proteins, or other endogenous molecules of the organism in which it was formed."

def: "A calculated measurement of the degree to which a change in the size of the remaining kidney after surgical removal of the other kidney can be attributed to compensatory growth, calculated as the ratio of the normalized weight of a single kidney at the time of surgical removal divided by the similarly normalized weight of the single remaining kidney at a specified period of time after removal. The normalized kidney weight is the weight of the kidney corrected for body weight using an empirically determined allometric scaling factor (i.e., an exponential factor which adjusts for the normal increase in kidney weight due to normal growth and development of the individual). Compensatory growth is the phenomenon in which the impaired function of one organ in a paired organ system or of part of an organ in a single organ system is followed by enlargement of the surviving organ or tissue so that functional capacity is maintained. Kidney is the paired organ which functions to maintain proper water and electrolyte balance, regulate acid-base concentration, and filter the blood of metabolic wastes."

name: ratio of the effective renal plasma flow to the weight of both kidneys
def: "A calculated measurement in which the effective renal plasma flow rate (eRPF) is divided by weight (i.e. the heaviness or the degree to which an object is drawn toward the earth by gravity) of both kidneys and presented as a ratio, fraction, quotient or percentage. The eRPF is the amount of plasma that perfuses the renal tubules per unit time, derived by measurement of the clearance rate of a non-metabolizable solute such as para-aminohippurate (PAH). Plasma is the fibrinogen-containing fluid portion of the blood in which the particulate components are suspended. The kidneys are the paired organs that function to maintain proper water and electrolyte balance, regulate acid-base concentration, and filter the blood of metabolic wastes."

comment: The term "absolute change" refers to the subtraction of one value from another, as opposed to a dissimilarity of two values expressed as a ratio or as a percentage. In this context it is not intended to necessarily imply the difference expressed as an absolute value |n|, that is, the numeric value of the difference without regard to its sign.
